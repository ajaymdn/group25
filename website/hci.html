                in our project, and another with an individual

                  <div class="accordion-body">
                    I've played Star Wars Connect on Xbox which I found inaccurate as the motion was jittery. I also played
                    PS3 Move which was okay but also kind of clunky as it was paired with physical controllers.
                    Finally I used the Oculus Quest Headset which I had the best experience with compared to the other 
                    devices, capturing the motion motion accurately.

                  <div class="accordion-body">
                    Well if it makes the game more immersive then I'd definitely be more inclined to use it. Also motion capture is more appealing from
                    a fitness perspective as you are more active whilst playing. They are also more social, for example if I have friends around for instance,
                    I would prefer motion capture rather than traditional gaming.

                    As someone with accessibility issues, a lot of experience with games has been wasting money on
                    ones that advertised as accessible, but turn out in practice not to be. When playing online or competitive games, I have
                    found that other gamers are usually not sensitive to or understanding of my condition, which often puts me off playing
                    at all. Also, assistive gaming tech - such as the Xbox adaptive controller - can be quite pricey.

                <h2>Defining the Problem</h2>
              </header>
              <p>
                After brainstorming using our personas and interviews, we identified three key 
                user needs our project needed to solve to reach the greatest audience alongside 
                how we would achieve this.
                <ol>
                  <li><b>Immersion</b> - a more realistic gaming experience compared to traditional 
                    gaming methods. Achieved through more interactive aspects of motion and voice.
                  â€‹</li>
                  <li><b>Accessibility</b> â€“ provide a new format for previously disenfranchised users, 
                    i.e., those unable to use traditional controllers. Achieved through voice commands, 
                    prioritisation of more general motion over use of fine hand motion.â€‹â€‹
                  </li>
                  <li><b>Affordability</b> â€“ a new experience for low-cost requirement for equipment. 
                    Achieved through need for video camera alone.â€‹
                    â€‹</li>
                </ol>
                The focus was placed on implementing this gaming format in RPG and FPS games due to their 
                already immersive nature of playing as a sole character.â€‹
              </p>
              <p>
                Our identification of the three user needs came from our research of the user base. 
                For instance, a small survey conducted to determine peopleâ€™s interest in motion gaming 
                [6] indicated that the majority of people will engage with it if it is â€˜worthwhileâ€™. 
                Immersion is therefore essential to distinguish a motion gaming experience from a traditional 
                one. Another study on gaming device ownership [7] indicated that 46% of gamers use a laptop, 
                and so affordability and accessibility are important to enable users to play with the devices 
                they already have.â€‹
              </p>
              <p>
                Once we determined the needs of our userbase we began to consider more carefully the implementation. 
                To identify a game to base our first implementation on we researched all the Star Wars games available 
                and categorized them based on the mode and style of gameplay, format, etc. Consequently, we decided 
                to focus on The Knights of The Old Republic game as it is an RPG and includes key elements such as 
                combat and other gestures that one would want to execute through motion input. Studying this gave us 
                a better idea of how to go about sketching for our first prototype.â€‹

                To start off we created a series of sketches [8] which targeted the idea of movement, 
                look-around and a menu system. For movement we experimented with immersion and accessibility; 
                where we went with the use of hand movements/ leg movements. Another alternative was the use 
                of on-screen buttons where the user can place their hand/fist, which results in movement 
                (As if they were using arrow keys). However , based on user feedback, we concluded that using 
                on-screen buttons defeated the concept of immersion and thought it would be better to implement 
                visual movement of the legs/arms. As for the menu, we produced three iterations, but with the 
                idea of accessibility we wanted to go with a menu that uses less buttons to reduce clutter on 
                the GUI and go with four options of the menu.

              <p>
                To produce the actual prototype [9], we decided to design it using Figma software, 
                which allowed it to be more interactive. We created a prototype of the in-game movement 
                and look-around system. We decided to use real gestures for movement, as immersion was 
                identified as one of the needs of our users. Next, we recorded ourselves simulating several 
                different gestures to change the direction of the camera, until we ended up with the one 
                described in our prototype (dragging the camera with the active hand). We showed the set-up 
                settings and the motion prototype to our potential users, which provided us with the opportunity 
                to get feedback.â€‹
              â€‹</p>
              <center><img class="images container" src="assets/img/prototype1.png" alt="motioninput"></center>
              <p>
                In the second part of our work on prototypes, we focused on capturing the important functionality 
                of menu control using motion/voice input (we decided to include both control styles for greater 
                accessibility). These images show how we envisioned the radial menu implementation (which we chose as 
                the most appropriate for menu design based on feedback). We also provide detailed instructions on how 
                the user should navigate in our prototype, which are used to give users a better idea of how the real 
                game behaves. Finally, one of our team members recorded themselves on camera and "interacted" with the 
                menu prototype to validate the appropriateness of our design.â€‹
